# Clarity English

## Introduction

Clarity English is a novel, syntactically perfect, and consistent subset of English. It is designed to eliminate ambiguity and redundancy, making it ideal for clear communication between humans, as well as between humans and AI systems. This repository contains the specification for Clarity English, a growing lexicon, and parser implementations in Python and PHP.

## Goals of Clarity English

*   **Unambiguous Communication:**  Every sentence has a single, clear interpretation.
*   **Consistency:** No exceptions to grammatical rules.
*   **Learnability:** Easy to learn due to its simplified and regular structure.
*   **Machine Parsability:** Designed to be easily processed by computers, facilitating AI interaction and code generation.
*   **Reduced Redundancy:** Eliminate synonyms and unnecessary words, using modifiers for intensity.
*   **Logical Structure:** Follows a consistent subject-verb-object order and uses hierarchical concept chaining to represent complex ideas.

## Key Features

*   **Regularized Grammar:**
    *   All verbs follow consistent tense formation (e.g., "go-d" for past tense).
    *   Nouns have regular plurals (e.g., "cat-s").
    *   No grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, etc.).
*   **Modifier System:**
    *   Hyphens connect modifiers to clarify relationships (e.g., "big-red ball").
    *   Percentile modifiers indicate intensity (e.g., "hot (150%)" for "very hot").
*   **Hierarchical Concept Chaining:**
    *   Concepts are organized into categories and subcategories to show relationships (e.g., `Thing->Craft->Land->Vehicle->Car`).
*   **JSON Lexicon:**
    *   A growing lexicon of verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions stored in easy-to-manage JSON files.

## How to Use

### 1. Lexicon

The lexicon is located in the `/lexicon` directory. Each JSON file contains a list of words with their associated grammatical information, definitions, and sometimes hierarchical relationships.

*   You can use these files directly in your applications to access the Clarity English vocabulary.
*   The lexicon is constantly being expanded. Contributions are welcome!

### 2. Parser

The `/parser` directory contains implementations of the Clarity English parser in Python and PHP.

#### Python:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.x
2.  **Run:** Navigate to the `/parser` directory and execute the script:

    ```bash
    python clarity_parser.py
    ```
    The script will parse a set of example sentences (which you can modify) and print the parsed output.
#### PHP:

1.  **Prerequisites:** PHP 7.x or higher
2.  **Run:** Navigate to the `/parser` directory and execute the script:

    ```bash
    php clarity_parser.php
    ```

    The script will parse a set of example sentences (which you can modify) and print the parsed output.

**Example Usage (Python):**

```python
from clarity_parser import
parse_clarity_english

sentence = "The quickly-spinning red-blue top be-d a toy."
parsed_sentence = parse_clarity_english(sentence)

print(f"Sentence: {sentence}")
print(f"Parsed: {parsed_sentence}")

Contributing
Contributions to Clarity English are welcome! Here are some ways you can contribute:
 * Expand the Lexicon: Add new words and refine existing entries in the JSON lexicon files.
 * Improve the Parser: Enhance the parsing logic, add error handling, and improve efficiency.
 * Develop Test Cases: Create a comprehensive suite of test sentences to ensure the parser's accuracy.
 * Implement in Other Languages: Create parsers for other programming languages.
 * Develop Applications: Build applications that utilize Clarity English for various purposes (e.g., AI interaction, code generation, education).

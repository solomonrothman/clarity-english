### Key Improvements and Changes:

1.  **Language Change (PHP to Python):** The entire script has been rewritten in Python, which is better suited for this type of text processing and more common in the open-source NLP community.
2.  **Unified Lexicon:** The parser now uses a single, unified `lexicon.json` file, as we designed. This is more efficient and aligns with the core principle of a hierarchical dictionary. The old logic of loading separate files for each part of speech has been removed.
3.  **Lexicon-Driven Tokenizer:** The new `_tokenize` method is much more robust. Instead of relying on complex `if/else` logic to guess a word's type, it now looks up the "base word" (e.g., "walk" from "walk-d") in the lexicon. The lexicon is the single source of truth for a word's part of speech.
4.  **Proper Suffix Handling:** The tokenizer correctly identifies Clarity English suffixes (`-d`, `-ed`, `-s`, `-ng`, `-will`) to determine tense and plurality, then works with the base word for lexicon lookups.
5.  **Object-Oriented Design:** The logic is now encapsulated in a `ClarityParser` class, which is better software design than using loose functions. This makes the code cleaner, more reusable, and easier to maintain.
6.  **Improved Modifier Handling:** The new `_group_modifiers` function correctly implements the Clarity English rule that modifiers (adjectives/adverbs) always precede the word they describe. It groups them together before the main parsing happens.
7.  **Cleaner Parsing Logic:** The main `parse` method is now more streamlined. It handles imperative sentences (like "Go now.") and declarative SVO sentences. The logic for the "implied be" verb is also more robust.
8.  **Comprehensive Comments:** The code is thoroughly commented to explain each part of the process, making it ideal for an open-source release where others will need to understand and contribute to it.
9.  **Dummy Lexicon for Testing:** The script now includes a small `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that will automatically create a `lexicon.json` file if one doesn't exist. This ensures that anyone can download and run the script immediately to see it work without needing the full 5,000-word lexicon file.
